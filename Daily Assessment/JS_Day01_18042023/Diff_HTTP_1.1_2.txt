HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. 
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 
There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

Difference between HTTP1.1 & HTTP2

HTTP1.1:
1. It works on textual format
2. There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn't get its all resources.
3. it uses resources inlining for use getting multiple pages.
It compress data by itself.

HTTP2:
1. It works on binary protocol.
2. It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
3. It uses PUSH frame by server that connects all multiple pages.
4. It uses HPACK for data compression.
